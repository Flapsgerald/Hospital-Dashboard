🏥 Hospital Data Analysis Dashboard – Excel Project
This project explores a hospital dataset using Microsoft Excel to create an interactive dashboard for visualizing key health and operational insights such as patient outcomes, treatment costs, and demographics.

📌 Project Summary
This Excel dashboard was developed to help visualize and analyze:

Patient outcomes and readmission rates

Gender distribution across the dataset

Relationship between outcomes and patient satisfaction

Condition-wise cost analysis (Total & Average)

Cost breakdown by medical procedures

Length of hospital stay by condition

Interactive slicers were added for:

Condition

Gender

Outcome

📊 Features & Visuals
✅ Count of Outcomes (Recovered, Stable, etc.)

🔁 Readmission Rate Breakdown

👤 Gender Distribution (Pie Chart)

😊 Outcome by Satisfaction (Bar Chart)

💸 Cost by Condition and Procedure

⏱️ Average Length of Stay by Condition

🎛️ Interactive Slicers for filtering

🧰 Tools Used
Tool	Purpose
Excel	Dashboard creation, charts
Pivot Tables	Aggregating metrics
Slicers	Filtering data visually
Bar, Pie, Column Charts	Data storytelling

📥 Dataset
The dataset was manually recreated based on a structured hospital records format. It includes patient IDs, condition, procedure, cost, satisfaction rating, and outcome status.

🧠 Key Takeaways
Conditions like Heart Disease and Cancer drive the highest treatment costs.

Patients with Fractures and Appendicitis tend to have shorter stays and higher satisfaction.

Slicers improve dashboard usability and interactivity for stakeholders.
